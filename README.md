## Build instructions

* Clone latest release of this repository into your [ROS2 workspace](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace/)
* Source ROS2 `source /path/to/your/ros/distro/folder/setup.bash`
* Run `colcon build` from your workspace folder
* Setup your workspace `source /path/to/your/workspace/install/setup.bash`

**Note**: Typesupport must be built and sourced before any project messages are built.  
**Note 2**: If you are using messages that are not being built by project (ex. builtin_interfaces) they need to be rebuilt and sourced in your workspace.
